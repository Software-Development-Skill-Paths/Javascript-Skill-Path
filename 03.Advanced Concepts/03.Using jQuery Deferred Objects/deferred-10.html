          * 
          * Note: When we reject our custom Deferred object in the 
          * loadSection(), this IMMEDIATELY rejects the Deferred 
          * object that is used by the .when() where our loadSection()
          * was called. This causes the .fail() and .always() processes
          * associated with the .when() to IMMEDIATELY be processed
          * processed because once the state of a Deferred Object is 
          * established, it cannot be changed. When the Deferred Object
          * in our loadSection() is rejected, nothing will happen again
          * to any other Deferred Objects within our code
          *

                * THE MESSAGE AREA AND KEEP PROCESSING. WHEN EVERYTHING IS

                * 
                * The reason we want our logic to run like this is because
                * we are directly handling the errors in the loadSection()
                * function so there is really no need to reject our Custom 
                * Deferred Object within the loadSection() function. We 
                * can instead resolve our Deferred Object so that processing
                * within the loadSection() continues and our Deferred does
                * not get rejected. We accomplish this by changing all our
                * reject() methods within the loadSection() function to 
                * resolve() methods
